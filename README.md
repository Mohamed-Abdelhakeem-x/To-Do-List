# 📝 C++ To-Do List Console Application

## Overview

A command-line **To-Do List Manager** built using **C++** with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Data Structures**. The application allows users to manage daily tasks with options to add, remove, mark, check, and display tasks.

## ✨ Features

- Add a new task  
- Remove an existing task  
- Display all tasks  
- Display only completed tasks  
- Mark tasks as done  
- Check if a specific task is completed  
- Clear all tasks  
- Display the total number of tasks  
- Exit the application safely

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**  
- **OOP Principles** (Encapsulation, Abstraction, etc.)  
- **Custom Classes** (`ToDoList`, `Task`)  
- **Standard Template Library (STL)** where applicable  
- **Console I/O** for interaction

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- **Class design and encapsulation**  
- **Dynamic data management using vectors or lists**  
- **Menu-driven interaction using loops and conditionals**  
- **Modular code with header files and implementation separation**
